I've learned a lot in the last month. I've learned that the 'case:' part of switch statements is a label and doesn’t have its own scope. So [obviously](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/92396/why-cant-variables-be-declared-in-a-switch-statement) you can't declare variables in them (wasn’t so obvious to me!). I've learned that setting up certificates and provisioning profiles for iOS is more painful than it should be (two iOS dev accounts and three xCode installs later I finally got our app running on an old iPhone). The most valuable thing I've learned though is the value of continuous feedback in a startup. 

A startup always begins with an idea. Maybe it’s a solution to a problem you’ve experienced. Or, perhaps you’ve analyzed a market and found a niche you can capture. Now, you have an idea – what’s next? If you’re a developer/creator/engineer your instinct is to go out and build it. 

However, just as important as building it is getting feedback on what you’re building and modifying your design to incorporate that feedback along the way. Getting feedback is easier said than done. Triangle startup weekend provided us with an excellent opportunity to get feedback from people that we really haven’t had since. We had three people use an early version of our application, but we should have gotten more feedback from users. The next step, incorporating feedback into your design, is just as important and perhaps more difficult. There will be users that want completely opposite features. One of the ways to address this is to include customization so a user can configure their experience to their preferences. If you do this for every feature you’ll end up with a poor user experience and bloated design. Not to mention a large time investment. We sat down and evaluated the feedback we got and then implemented functionality that had the highest value to the most people.

Share your concept with others. Ask for feedback. Embrace change. Our startup concept has changed a lot since we started, but its now something real people are interested in.
