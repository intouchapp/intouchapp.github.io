My idea got left at the altar during the Friday night pitches for Triangle Startup Weekend. I had done an ok 60-second pitch in front of the room, but I was really proud I followed it up with two small “hacks” to give my idea a little edge over the competition: I placed my pitch’s poster right at the intersection of the only way out of the main seating area (instead of hidden under the stairs as the other pitches who had gone before me had done) which gave me a guaranteed crowd during the voting process, and then spent the next 20 minutes standing by the poster getting my best engineer hustle on to anyone who would listen.

I was actually so confident my idea was moving on after it was removed from the wall with the other high vote count projects that I spent my three votes on other teams that I thought had underrated ideas and deserved more attention then they were getting.

But when the votes were tallied I had apparently fallen short… by two.

Wandering around after the teams gave their pitches to the remnants, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. I really didn’t want to be stubborn and be married to an idea, which had no value and short-change my Startup Weekend experience. So I started walking around the room looking for the best team that had a project I thought I could contribute to, but didn’t find anything that stuck out to me. Which is when I bumped into another rogue developer, Ibraheem Khalifa, who was also trying to figure out what to work on. We clicked instantly, and I tried to pitch him on a slightly modified version of his idea and we didn’t waste time getting right to work.

Our first idea was pretty quickly thwarted by a certain recent Amazon product, so we jumped around on a number of ideas before settling on something similar to my original pitch. Since it was already pretty late Friday night, we just spent a little time doing some pair-programming to work out the high-level architecture of the app.

In the last 24 hours since then we’ve written over 1,300 lines of code, developed a prototype, got feedback from real users of the app, and have refined the product further based on that feedback and more ideas from the mentors (thanks John!). We’re well on pace to make a pitch tomorrow (~12 hours away!) for a really simple product, but its an real app that has been built on a two-person-team’s work this weekend, and one that I know (based on our interviews) will really impact the way people network with others.

Startup Weekend is great for trying out crazy ideas and for hands-on learning about the startup world, but if you work a little harder it can also be a great way to meet talented people who have a passion for building rather than talking. It’s pretty damn cool if you ask me.
