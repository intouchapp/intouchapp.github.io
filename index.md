InTouch started out as an idea we had at [Triangle Startup Weekend 2013](http://triangle.startupweekend.org/). It has since grown into a mobile app that allows you to quickly organize and connect with your networks. It features connectivity with your local address book and LinkedIn. Currently we supports iOS only.
